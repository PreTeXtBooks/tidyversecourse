  <title>Preface</title>

  <p>
    This book demonstrates how to use the Tidyverse collection of packages for
    doing data science in R. The <url href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</url>
    is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All
    packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this book we cover the simple idea of <q>tidy data</q> and how this idea
    serves to organize data for analysis and modeling. We cover the data science
    project life cycle and the ecosystem of Tidyverse R packages that can be
    used at each step: importing data, tidying data, exploring and visualizing
    data, and building prediction models. We assume familiarity with the R
    programming language. If you are not yet familiar with R, we suggest you
    first complete <url href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming">R
    Programming</url> before returning to complete this book.
